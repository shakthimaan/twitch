* The Organization of the Screen

** Introduction

Use GNU Emacs on the X Window System or the terminal.

It normally starts with only one frame.

Menu bar at the top.

Below the menu bar is the tool bar.

At the very bottom is the echo area.

The main area is called the window. Each window has a buffer.

The window can have a scroll bar on one side.

The last line of the window is the mode line.

You can have multiple windows and frames.

At any time, only one window is selected, and this has the cursor. It
is called the current buffer.

** Point

The cursor in the selected window is called the point.

It is a solid block, and is between two characters.

For a text "frob", and cursor on "b", it means it is between 'o' and 'b'.

Inserting '!' gives "fro!b", and the cursor remains on 'b'.

Each buffer has its own value of point, and the display remembers the same.

** The Echo Area

The characters of commands are echoed.

It may also prompt you for completion.

Error messages can also be displayed.

Informative messages can also be displayed.

For example, "C-x =" echoes the character value.

Informative echo area messages are also saved in the *Messages* buffer.

If you miss a message, you can check the *Messages* buffer.

Var: "message-log-max" specifies the *Messages* buffer line number limit.

The echo area is also used to display the minibuffer to input arguments to commands.

The prompt string appears in the minibuffer temporarily.

You can get out of the minibuffer by using C-g.

** The Mode Line

The Mode Line format:

  cs:ch-fr buf pos line (major minor)

cs = Coding System
- No special character set handling
= Files containing non-textual data
1 ISO Latin-1

cs is followed by:
':' Text separated by newline characters in a file
'\' MS-DOS convention that uses a carriage return instead of a newline
'/' or '(Mac)' for older Macintosh systems
'(Unix)' on some systems

Frames with emacsclient have '@' to indicate Emacs process running as a daemon.

The ch shows two dashes:
'--' if the buffer is unmodified
'**' if the buffer is modified
'%*' for a read-only buffer

The character after ch is a '-'.
For a remote machine, '@' is displayed.

fr gives the selected frame name.

buf is the name of the buffer.

pos tells if there is additional text above or below.

If buffer is small, pos is 'All'.
If you are at the beginning, pos is 'Top'.
If you are at the end of the buffer, pos is 'Bot'.
Or it is 'nn%' where nn is the percentage of the buffer above the top of the window.

line is the character 'L' followed by the number of at point.

After enabling Column Number mode, you can display the current column number too.

major is the major mode used in the buffer, which is the principal editing mode in the buffer.
Examples: Text mode, Lisp mode, C mode etc.

Some additional information may be displayed after the major made.
Examples: Compilation buffer, shell buffer etc.

minor is the list of minor modes, which are optional editing modes.

Narrow means editing is restricted to a portion of the text.

'Def' means a keyboard macro is currently being defined.

In a recursive editing level, square brackets ('[...]') appear around
the parenthesis surrounding the mode.

The mode line is mouse-sensitive, and shows tooltips.

** The Menu Bar

Use the mouse to choose a command from the menu bar.

Select the first menu bar by pressing F10.

To select press RET and to cancel press G-g.

** Kinds of User Input

Primarily designed for use with the keyboard.

Commonly used modifier keys are Control and Meta.

Control-a is entered by holding Ctrl key while pressing 'a'.

Similarly, Meta-a.

You can enter M-a by typing Esc a.

ESC is entered as a special character. You don't hold down ESC while typing the next character.

C-M-a is by holding Ctrl and Alt and pressing 'a'.

Note: On graphical displays, window managers may block some keyboard
inputs, M-TAB, M-SPC, C-M-d and C-M-l.

So, customize window manager or rebind the keys.

Mouse clicks are referred to as input events.

* Keys

C-f moves forward one character.

Some commands take more input events:

C-x C-f

A key sequence or key is a sequence of one or more input events that is meaningful as a unit.

If a key sequence is not long enough to invoke a command, it is a prefix key.
Example: C-x

There is no limit to the length of the key sequences.

Keep it short to three or four input events.

You cannot add input events to a complete key, like C-f.

Default prefix keys:
C-c
C-h
C-x
C-x RET
C-x a
C-x n
C-x r
C-x t
C-x v
C-x 4
C-x 5
C-x 6
ESC
M-g
M-o

F1 and F2 are aliases for C-h and C-x 6.

You can customize, but, it is generally not recommended.

C-h or F1 after a prefix key displays the list of commands for the prefix.

* Keys and Commands

Emacs assigns meanings to named commands.

Emacs gives keys their meanings by binding them to commands.

Examples: next-line, forward-word etc.

Internally, each command is a Lisp function.

The actions associated with the command are performed by running the function.

The bindings between keys and commands are recorded in tables called keymaps.

Example: C-n (key) is bound to next-line.

We say, "The command C-n (next-line) moves point vertically down".

A variable is a name used to store a value. It is useful for customisation.

* Entering Emacs

From the terminal, you can start Emacs with the "emacs" command.

To run in the background, use "emacs &".

The inital frame is the buffer named "*GNU Emacs*".

The startup screen has information about Emacs and links to common tasks useful for beginners.

You can open the Emacs tutorial with C-h t (help-with-tutorial).

You can open a file with Emacs using "emacs foo.txt".

You can use emacsclient helper program to open a file in the existing Emacs session.

The inhibit-startup-screen is non-nil, it will not show the startup screen.

Use "initial-buffer-choice" to display a file or directory on startup.

* Exiting Emacs

C-x C-c (save-buffers-kill-terminal) to kill emacs.

C-z to suspend Emacs (runs command suspend-frame).

You can resume with the shell command %emacs.

If there are unsaved buffers, Emacs will prompt to save these buffers.

It will also ask for confirmation on any subprocesses that are still running.

For a client frame, it simply closes the connection.

Optionally, it can store session information.

If the value of the variable confirm-kill-emacs (default is nil) is non-nil, C-x C-c assumes it has a predicate function and invokes the same.

If the result of this function is non-nil, the session is killed. Otherwise, it continues to run.

One example function to use is yes-or-no-p.

If confirm-kill-processes (default is t) is nil, C-x C-c does not ask for confirmamtion.

To kill Emacs without being prompted, use M-x kill-emacs.

* Basic Editing Commands
** Inserting Text

The insertion point moves after entering text.

Use RET (newline) to start a new line.

You can also use C-j.

You can change the way Emacs handles text insertion by turning on minor modes.

In Auto Fill mode, lines are split automatically when they get too long.

Overwrite minor mode causes characters to be replaced (overwritten).

DEL runs the command delete-backward-char.

To insert non-graphic characters, start with C-q (quoted-insert).

Example: C-q DEL
         C-q 101B (inserts AB)

To use decimal or hexadecimal set variable read-quoted-char-radix to 10 or 16.

Unicode characters can be inserted using C-x 8.

Example: C-x 8 [ inserts '
         C-x 8 ] inserts '
         C-x 8 { inserts "
         C-x 8 } inserts "

TODO: A-[ behaves like C-x 8 [ and inserts '.

To find what key binding use C-x 8 C-h.

Example: C-x 8 C inserts Â©.

C-x 8 RET (insert-char) to prompt for Unicode name.

Example: Bactrian Camel.

You can input either:
1. Unicode name
2. Hexadecimal value (Unicode convention)
3. Specified radix (octal)

The following return the same ' character:

C-x 8 RET left single quotation mark RET
C-x 8 RET left sin TAB RET
C-x 8 RET 2018 RET
C-x 8 [
TODO A-[  (if the Alt key works)
`    (in Electric Quote mode)

A numeric argument to C-q or C-x 8 specifies how many copies of the character to insert.

** Changing the Location of Point

To move point to:

C-f (forward-char) 
C-b (backward-char)
C-p (previous-line)
C-n (next-line)

You can also use arrow keys or left mouse button to move the point.

Arrow keys
RIGHT (right-char)
LEFT  (left-char)
UP    (previous-line)
DOWN  (next-line)

C-a (move-beginning-of-line)
HOME Move to the beginning of line

C-e (move-end-of-line)
END Move to the end of the line

M-f (forward-word)
C-RIGHT

M-RIGHT (right-word)
It moves backward by one word if the current paragraph is right-to-left.
Example: Bi-directional editing (Arabic, Farsi and Hebrew)

M-b (backward-word)
Move backward one word

C-LEFT
M-LEFT (left-word)
It moves forward by one word if the current paragraph is right-to-left.

M-r (move-to-window-line-top-bottom)
Reposition point on the left margin of the center-most text line of window.
On subsequent invocations move to top-most line, bottom-most line and so forth (in cyclic).

M-< (beginning-of-buffer)
Move to the top of the buffer

With numeric argument n, move to n/10 of the way from the top.

M-> (end-of-buffer)
C-END
Move to the end of the buffer.

C-v
PageDown
next
Scroll the display one screen forward and move point onscreen if necessary (scroll-up-command).

M-v
PageUp
prior
Scroll one screen backward, and move point if necessary (scroll-down-command).

M-g c
Read a number n and move point to buffer position n. Beginning of the buffer is position 1.

M-g M-g
M-g g
Read a number n and move point to the beginning of the line number n (goto-line).
Line 1 is the beginning of the buffer.

M-g TAB
Read a number n and move to column n in the current line.
Column 0 is the letmost column.

C-x C-n Use the current column of the point as the semipermanent goal
column for C-n and C-p in the current buffer.

These commands try to move to this column, or close to it as possible.

C-u C-x C-n
Cancel the goal column.

You can force Emacs to move according to logical lines (text lines in
the buffer) by setting variable line-move-visual to nil.

If a logical line occupies multiple screen lines, the cursor then skips over the additional lines.

When line-move-visual is nil, if you set track-eol to non-nil, then
C-n and C-p start at the end of the logical line, and move to the end
of the next logical line.

By default, track-eol is nil.

Setting next-line-add-newlines to non-nil, and using C-n on the last
line creates an additional line at the end and moves down to it.

** Erasing Text

DEL (delete-backward-char)
BACKSPACE
Delete the character before point, or the region if it is active.

DEL is not the Delete key. The Delete command deletes the character
under the cursor.

DEL removes character before point, moving cursor and characters after
it backwards.

If point is at the beginning of a line, it deletes the preceding
newlin, and joins the line to the previous one.

If a region is active, DEL deletes the text in the region.

Delete (delete-forward-char)
Delete character afte point, or the region if it activ.

C-d (delete-char)
Delete the character at point. 

If the point is at the end of the line, it joins the following line to it.

C-k (kill-line)
Kill to the end of line.

M-d (kill-word)
Kill forward to the end of the next word 

M-DEL (backward-kill-word)
M-BACKSPACE

Kill back to the beginning of the previous word.

** Undoing Changes

C-/
C-x u
C-_

Unde one entry of the undo records.

Normally, it undoes the last change, moving point back to where it was
before the change.

If you repeat C-/, each repetition undoes another, earlier change.

If all changes are undone, the undo command displays an error message
and does nothing.

** Files

To begin editing a file use:

C-x C-f <file> RET

C-x C-f (find-file) uses minibuffer to read the argument.

It creates a buffer, copies the contents of the file into the buffer,
and displays the same for editing.

C-x C-s (save-buffer)

It copies the altered buffer contents back into the file, making it permanent.

To create a new file, just use C-x C-f. This will create an empty
buffer, which you can modify and save.

** Help

C-h k (describe-key)

Example:
C-h k C-n 

C-h stands for "help".

F1 stands as an alias for C-h.

** Blank Lines

C-o (open-line)
Insert a blank line after the cursor.

Note, unlike C-j, the point does not move.

C-x C-o (delete-blank-lines)

Delete all but one of many consecutive blank lines.

** Continuation Lines

On a text terminal, Emacs displays line wrapping by displaying a `\`
character at the right margin.

C-k kills a logical line.

C-n (next-line)
C-p (previous-line)
These are exceptions that move one screen line.

On a graphical display, a truncated line is indicated by a small
straight arrow in the right fringe.

On a text terminal, it is indicated by a '$' character in the right
margin.

You can make Emacs insert a newline automatically when a line gets too
long (Auto Fill mode).

Visual Line mode enables word wrapping at word boundaries (space or
tab characters) nearest to the right window edge.

It also redefines editing commands such as C-a, C-n, and C-k to
operate on screen lines rather than logical lines.

** Cursor Position Information

M-x what-line
Display the line number point in the echo area.

M-x line-number-mode
M-x column-number-mode
Toggle automatically display of the current line number or column number.

M-= (count-words-region)
Display the number of lines, words and characters that are present in
the region.

With prefix, C-u M-=, the command displays a count for the entire buffer.

M-x count-words
Displays the number of lines, words and characters that are present in the buffer.
If region is active, displays the numbers for the region.

C-x = 
Display the character code of character at point, and column of point (what-cursor-position).

Example:
Char: c (99, #o143, #x63) point=28062 of 36168 (78%) column=53

a. Decimal, octal and hex character codes.
b. 'point=' shows the position of the point as a character count.
c. Total number of characters in the buffer (percentage of the total)
d. 'column=' horizontal position of point.

If what-cursor-show-names is true, the name of the character defined
by the Unicode Character Database is shown.

Example:
(99, #o143, #x63, LATIN SMALL LETTER C)

For narrowed buffer, additional text describing the range is displayed.

Example:
Char: C (67, #o103, #x43) point=252 of 889 (28%) <231-599> column=0

M-x hl-line-mode
Enable or disabling highlighting of the current line.

M-x size-indication-mode
Toggle automatic display of the size of the buffer.

** Numeric Arguments

No argument is equivalent to an argument of one.

M-1, M-2 are bound to digit-argument.

M-5 C-n

Negative arguments can be passed.

M-- means -1.

M-- is bound to negative-argument.

To move down fifty lines, use:

M-5 0 C-n

To insert five zeroes use:

M-5 C-u 0

C-u terminates the prefix argument.

C-u alone has the special meaning of "four times".

It multiplies the argument for the next command by four.

C-u C-u multiplies by sixteen.

C-u C-u C-f moves forward sixteen characters.

C-u C-n
C-u C-u C-n
Move down a good fraction of the screen.

C-u C-u C-o
Make sixteen blank lines.

C-u C-k
Kill four lines.

C-u 6 4 a
Insert 64 copies of the character 'a'.

C-u 6 4 1
Specifies an argument of 641.

You can separate the argument from the digit with another C-u.

C-u 6 4 C-u 1
Inserts 64 copies of the character '1'.

M-q (fill-paragraph)
It fills text.

With an argument, it justifies the text as well.

C-k with argument n can kill n lines.

C-u 2 C-k

On graphical displayes, C-0, C-1 behave the same as M-0, M-1 etc.

** Repeating a Command

If the command you want to repeat needs user input, the M-x
command-name RET may not work for numeric arguments.

C-x z (repeat)
Another way to repeat an Emacs command many times.

It repeats the previous Emacs command.

For more than once, type additional 'z'.

Repetition ends when you type a character other than 'z' or press a
mouse button.

C-u 2 0 C-d to delete 20 characters.
To delete 80 characters, type C-x z z z.
